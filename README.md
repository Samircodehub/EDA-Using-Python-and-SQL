# Data-Analytics-Projects:

This repository is mainly for projects in data analysis.

 As a data analyst I learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib,seaborn), SQL and tableau as I build a portfolio of projects .


## Part 1 - Data Analysis using python

### Subjects Covered:

Anaconda: Learn to use Anaconda to manage packages and environments for use with Python
Jupyter Notebook: Learn to use this open-source web application
Data Analysis Process
NumPy for 1 and 2D Data
Pandas Series and Dataframes


### Project 1: Explore Weather Trends with weather forecast data

In this project, I choose one datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas. I complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing the findings. ( It may be better to place this section inside the readme of the project 1)

### Project 2: Data Analysis and Visualization for Covid-19 data set

##  Data Extraction and Wrangling using Python

Subjects Covered:

#### GATHERING DATA:
Gather data from multiple sources, including gathering files, programmatically downloading files, web-scraping data, and accessing data from APIs
Import data of various file formats into pandas, including flat files (e.g. TSV), HTML files, TXT files, and JSON files
Store gathered data in a PostgreSQL database
#### ASSESSING DATA
Assess data visually and programmatically using pandas
Distinguish between dirty data (content or “quality” issues) and messy data (structural or “tidiness” issues)
Identify data quality issues and categorize them using metrics: validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity
#### CLEANING DATA
Identify each step of the data cleaning process (defining, coding,and testing)
Clean data using Python and pandas
Test cleaning code visually and programmatically using Pytho

### Project 3 : Data Wrangle and Analyze with Zomato data

Collect data from  source and assess data using different libraries and programmatically clean data for visulizing data and finding insights later.

### Project 4 : Data Wrangle and Analyze with Netflix data

Collect data from different sources and assess data visually and programmatically , clean data for visulizing data and finding insights later.




## Part 2 - Data Analysis using SQL

### Project 5 : Data analysis with mavenmovies data

### Project 6 : Data analysis with sales dataset


## Part 3 - Data visualization using tableau

### Project 7 : Park City Peaks Hotel  Dashboard for Data Analysis
![Park+City+Peaks+Hotel LOGO](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108605935/179173778-6a102840-db89-4032-94e9-7dcf6af1e706.jpeg)

Park City Peaks Hotel provides hotel accommodation to tourists and business travellers.
At the moment, the hotel manager can get an excel spreadsheet that he downloads from the Hotel Booking system. He has given us the spreadsheet and would like to see the following:
Bookings and Cancellations the hotel gets in a monthly basis 
Repeated Guests Statistics 
The food option guests generally chooses 
Do they get singular travellers or family bookings on average?


### Project 8 : Greatfit Dashbord for Data Analysis
![GREATFIT+LOGO](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108605935/179174342-3c1ce1a9-a8b9-407e-9164-f2135d8bd168.png)

Greatfit is an online e-commerce store that sells ladies clothing. They make a lot of sales through various platforms. Customers generally leave reviews and Greatfit hasn't been doing any analytics and investigation in the reviews. The Customer Service manager has asked you to develop a dashboard to give her an idea of how the reviews are. She wants the following 1.Do they get a lot of negative/positive reviews? 2.Analysis on the reviews by division 3.Do people recommend their products? 4.Do reviews mention anything about returning items?

### Project 9 : Olist Store Dashboard for Data Analysis
![OLIST+LOGO (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108605935/179174898-99b8b33d-bccc-47c6-bdba-9f44d124d71a.jpeg)

Olist is an online e-commerce store which sells and delivers items all over Brazil. The Logistics Manager, doesn't receive any reporting and works off a few spreadsheets. He is responsible for optimizing the purchase and delivery process. He explains below what this consists: When a customer orders from us, they make a purchase online. We then deliver all the orders. It is important for us to deliver orders within the estimated delivery date we have given to the customer otherwise the customers complain if their order is late. I want to have a line of sight of orders that have not been delivered yet.

Using this information, he would like the following on a monthly basis: 
Total Orders per Month 
Number of orders delivered after the estimated delivery date given to the customer 
Orders outstanding delivery
