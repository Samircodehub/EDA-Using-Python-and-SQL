# Data-Analytics-Projects:

This repository is mainly for projects in data analysis.

 As a data analyst I learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib,seaborn), SQL and Tabluea as I build a portfolio of projects .


## Part 1 - Data Analysis using python

### Subjects Covered:

Anaconda: Learn to use Anaconda to manage packages and environments for use with Python
Jupyter Notebook: Learn to use this open-source web application
Data Analysis Process
NumPy for 1 and 2D Data
Pandas Series and Dataframes


### Project 1: Explore Weather Trends with weather forecast data
In this project, I choose one datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas. I complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing the findings. ( It may be better to place this section inside the readme of the project 1)

### Project 2: EDA on Covid-19 data set
I was provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an netflix. I used  questions about the data and report my conclusions and recommendations in a report.



##  Data Extraction and Wrangling using Python

Subjects Covered:

#### GATHERING DATA:
Gather data from multiple sources, including gathering files, programmatically downloading files, web-scraping data, and accessing data from APIs
Import data of various file formats into pandas, including flat files (e.g. TSV), HTML files, TXT files, and JSON files
Store gathered data in a PostgreSQL database
#### ASSESSING DATA
Assess data visually and programmatically using pandas
Distinguish between dirty data (content or “quality” issues) and messy data (structural or “tidiness” issues)
Identify data quality issues and categorize them using metrics: validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity
#### CLEANING DATA
Identify each step of the data cleaning process (defining, coding,and testing)
Clean data using Python and pandas
Test cleaning code visually and programmatically using Pytho

### Project 3 : Data Wrangle and Analyze with Zomato data
Collect data from  source and assess data using different libraries and programmatically clean data for visulizing data and finding insights later.

### Project 4 : Data Wrangle and Analyze with Netflix data
Collect data from different sources and assess data visually and programmatically , clean data for visulizing data and finding insights later.




# Part 2 - Data Analysis using SQL

### Project 5 : Data analysis with mavenmovies data

### Project 6 : Data analysis with sales dataset


# Part 3 - Data visualisation using Tabluea

## Project 7 : Park City Peaks Hotel

Park City Peaks Hotel provides hotel accommodation to tourists and business travellers.
At the moment, the hotel manager can get an excel spreadsheet that he downloads from the Hotel Booking system. He has given us the spreadsheet and would like to see the following:
Bookings and Cancellations the hotel gets in a monthly basis 
Repeated Guests Statistics 
The food option guests generally chooses 
Do they get singular travellers or family bookings on average?
