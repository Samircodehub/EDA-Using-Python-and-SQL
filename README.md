Data-Analytics-Projects:

This repository is mainly for projects in data analysis.

 As a data analyst I learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib,seaborn), SQL and Tabluea as I build a portfolio of projects .


Part 1 - Intro to Data Analysis

Subjects Covered:

Anaconda: Learn to use Anaconda to manage packages and environments for use with Python
Jupyter Notebook: Learn to use this open-source web application
Data Analysis Process
NumPy for 1 and 2D Data
Pandas Series and Dataframes


Project 1: Explore Weather Trends with weather forecast data
In this project, I choose one datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas. I complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing the findings. ( It may be better to place this section inside the readme of the project 1)
