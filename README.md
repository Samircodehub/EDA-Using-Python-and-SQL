# Data-Analytics-Projects:

This repository is mainly for projects in data analysis.

 As a data analyst I learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib,seaborn), SQL and Tabluea as I build a portfolio of projects .


## Part 1 - Intro to Data Analysis

### Subjects Covered:

Anaconda: Learn to use Anaconda to manage packages and environments for use with Python
Jupyter Notebook: Learn to use this open-source web application
Data Analysis Process
NumPy for 1 and 2D Data
Pandas Series and Dataframes


## Project 1: Explore Weather Trends with weather forecast data
In this project, I choose one datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas. I complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing the findings. ( It may be better to place this section inside the readme of the project 1)

## Project 2: EDA on Netflix data set
I was provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an netflix. I used  questions about the data and report my conclusions and recommendations in a report.



## Part 2 - Data Extraction and Wrangling

Subjects Covered:

#### GATHERING DATA:
Gather data from multiple sources, including gathering files, programmatically downloading files, web-scraping data, and accessing data from APIs
Import data of various file formats into pandas, including flat files (e.g. TSV), HTML files, TXT files, and JSON files
Store gathered data in a PostgreSQL database
#### ASSESSING DATA
Assess data visually and programmatically using pandas
Distinguish between dirty data (content or “quality” issues) and messy data (structural or “tidiness” issues)
Identify data quality issues and categorize them using metrics: validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity
#### CLEANING DATA
Identify each step of the data cleaning process (defining, coding,and testing)
Clean data using Python and pandas
Test cleaning code visually and programmatically using Pytho
